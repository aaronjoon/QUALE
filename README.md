README:

The time is currently 3:30 AM EST, and I am tired and in pain.

However, we have some resulting code.

The files are generally split according to these principles.

1) Main.py is where we define our circuit (100% accurate, let's go!!!!). We also have some various global variables we reference that are defined here

2) training.py is where we actually run our training model. It works, maybe. Check slides for our analysis of it's accuracy. We swear it's gotten better.

3) loss.py: our math wizard Pradyun himself did the required matlab to get the loss function defined in the paper working. All hail tao hat :)

4) plot.py: how we generated the great graphs that we gave you on the slides.
